# 🔬 Cirrhosis Multiclass Classification

This project focuses on predicting the stage of liver cirrhosis using clinical patient data. It explores multiclass classification techniques by comparing Random Forest and XGBoost models. Key features include:
- ✅ Model comparison between Random Forest and XGBoost
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization
- 🔄 SMOTE applied to address class imbalance

📊 The project aims to provide accurate classification of disease progression to support medical decision-making.
> 🧠 Note:
To reduce the risk of late diagnoses (e.g., predicting Stage 2 when the actual stage is Stage 3), the model prioritizes recall for critical stages such as Stage 3 and Stage 4.
